# Machine Learning Trading Bot
Many financial advisory firms manage and automatically trade assets by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders. While these programmed algorithms are useful, they need to be able to adapt to new data. In order to make these algorithmic trading systems adapt to new data, we can use machine learning algorithms. This repository uses algorithmic trading skills, Python programming, and machine learning to create an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets.  

The data used for this repository is an MCSI-based emerging markets ETF that iShares issued. Investments in emerging markets often have higher long-term returns, but they carry more risk. The data includes the open, high, low, close, and volumne (OHLCV) information.
